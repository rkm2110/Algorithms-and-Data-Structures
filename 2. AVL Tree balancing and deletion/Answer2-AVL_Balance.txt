Balancing of AVL Trees:

Balancing of AVL trees can be divided into following 4 types as per their shapes:

Case 1: Left-Straight-Line

a,b,c and d are nodes.
Here, the unbalance is at node 1. It forms a left straight line.
Steps : 1 becomes right child of 2 and c detaches from 2 and becomes left child of 1.

         1                                      2 
        / \                                   /   \
       2   d       Rotate 1 right            3      1
      / \          --------------->        /  \    /  \ 
     3   c                                a    b  c    d
    / \
   a   b


Case 2: Right-Straight-Line

a,b,c and d are nodes.
Here, the unbalance is at node 1. It forms a right straight line.
Steps : 1 becomes left child of 2 and b detaches from 2 and becomes right child of 1.

         1                                           2 
        / \                                        /   \
       a   2          Rotate 1 left               1      3
          / \          --------------->         /  \    /  \ 
         b   3                                 a    b  c    d
            / \
           c   d


Case 3: Left-Zigzag

a,b,c and d are nodes.
Here, the unbalance is at node 1. It forms a Left-Zigzag.
This is balanced in 2 steps:
Step 1: First make it a Left-Straight-Line : Move 3 to the place of 2 and make 2 as it's left child. Move c from 3 and make it the right child of 2.
Step 2: Balance it like usual Left-Straight-Line : 1 becomes right child of 3 and d detaches from 3 and becomes left child of 1.

        / \                                         / \                                    /   \     
       2   a    Make it Left-Straight-Line         3   a          Rotate 1 right          2      1

        / \                                     / \                                                   
       c   d                                   b   c                                                            


Case 4: Right-Zigzag

a,b,c and d are nodes.
Here, the unbalance is at node 1. It forms a Right-Zigzag.
This is balanced in 2 steps:
Step 1: First make it a Right-Straight-Line : Move 3 to the place of 2 and make 2 as it's right child. Move d from 3 and make it the left child of 2.
Step 2: Balance it like usual Right-Straight-Line : 1 becomes left child of 3 and c detaches from 3 and becomes right child of 1.

       a    2       Make it Right-Straight-Line     a   3             Rotate 1 left        1      2
